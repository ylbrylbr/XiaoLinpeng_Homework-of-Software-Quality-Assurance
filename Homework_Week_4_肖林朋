Why DFT
CFT is cool, but there are still some problems about Dependency and sequencing. 
These problems make the test of software uncompleted or too complicated, 
so that we need for a another way to test our software from a different aspect. 
That may find other defects in program. 
DFT(Date Flow Testing) is a technology which can detect problems about data dependency and optimize performance of program. 
There are two important concepts in DFT. They are Data Flow(Date Dependency) and Data Slice.

Data Operation & Date Flow
There are two kind of data operation in DFT, Define(D) and Use(U). D mean create, initialize and assign data. 
And U involve computational and preidcate charactistics of data operations. We should focus on Define and relate Use. 
There are some method to analysis data dpendency problem. 
U-U and D-U are ok. And if you found D-D, U-D, there may be some problems in your program, and you should focus on this.
DFT focuses on testing D-U relations. We can use DDG help us to analysis software.

Data Slice
Data Slice is another technology to test software. 
Data slice is data item and all information needed to dertermine it' value. 
Data slice is use to slice the program into pieces by data usage. 
So that when bug happens, use data slice can locate the wrong code rapidly. 
It's usefull but we still need some skill to master it. The most notable thing is sensitization in DFT. 
There are some priniple we need to follow, and handle correalations/connections carefully.
