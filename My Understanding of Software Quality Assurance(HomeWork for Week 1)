understanding of software quality assurance

The concept of Assurance of Software Quality is based on the principle of establishing good software engineering practices and monitoring adherence to those practices throughout the software development life-cycle.

It must beunderstood that quality cannot be the assigned function of any one person or organization; rather, it must be the primary responsibility of every person involved in the development of a product.  The role of Software Quality Assurance, then, is to influence everyone to perform their function in a quality manner. The basis for this philosophy is that the consistent use of a quality process will result in a quality product
